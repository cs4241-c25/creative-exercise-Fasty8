Formatting: For the formatting I based it off the original getting started page. For the buttons I based the circle button off the example SVG Scripting page for the circle radius and used that concept for the ellipse and rectange, but then for the circle I just did random movement and solved that conceptually and by using the math.random function. 
Overall: My program has 5 shapes: A circle, rectangle, ellipse, pentagon, and a hexagon. All have various colors associated with them. Then there are 4 buttons: Random circle movement which moves the circle to a random spot on the webpage. Grow Rectangle which doubles the rectangles size every time the button is pressed. Shrink Ellipse which halves the size of the ellipse each time the button is pressed. Reset All Shapes which restores the circle, rectangle, and ellipse to their respective positions and sizes.
